# Lectures notes for Functional Programming Design in Scala by Martin Odersky

- Rating: 3/5
- Summary: This is the second part of a specialization. While I thoroughly enjoyed the first, I found this part to be a bit too theoretical at times. I suppose many concepts that were taught (like type-directed programming or functional reactive programming) are simply not applicable to me or my work. However, I found "lazy evaluation" to be a really interesting concept, and loved the homework for creating a Bloxorz game. Overall, I found the homeworks easier (and somewhat less interesting) than the first part of the series.
